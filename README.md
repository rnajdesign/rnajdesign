# 👋 Welcome to My GitHub  

Hi, I'm **Ramin** — a 33-year-old aspiring developer based in **London, Ontario**.  
After years of curiosity about tech, I’ve committed myself to learning software development and building a new career path.  

Right now, I’m enrolled in a **Web and Development Fundamentals** program where I’m sharpening the essentials of programming, problem-solving, and modern development practices. This GitHub is where I share my journey — from small experiments to full projects — as I grow into a professional developer.
